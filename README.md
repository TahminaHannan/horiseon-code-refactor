# Horiseon Refactor

## About this project

Hired by the Marketing Manager to refactor their landing page - Horiseon.
Tasked to modify the existing codebase to ensure it is more accessible and optimized for search engines. 

Previously, there were several elements in the HTML and CSS file that needed to be replaced, consolidated and fixed. The following changes were made to achieve the Marketing Managers criteria:

- [x] Updated the title of the webpage.
- [x] Viewport meta tag added to allow web content to be seen.
- [x] CSS selectors and properties have been reworked, looking cleaner and consolidated following a semanic structure.
- [x] Heading attributes fall in sequential order
- [x] HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
- [x] Image and icon elements contain accessible alt attributes.
- [x] All links in the navigation bar and 'seo' in 'Horiseon' are functioning correctly.
- [x] All div elements were replaced with semantic elements.
- [x] Comments added to section of the page to allow  to detail content and help in any future changes.
- [x] Quality README was created.

Note: The website layout is designed for desktop viewing, you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the mock-up at a resolution smaller than 768px.
This can be fixed by using responsive element so that your web application is optimized for any screen size.
